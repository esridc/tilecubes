# dc-crime

There are a few example apps here. The first is a [simple temporal visualization](http://ajturner.github.io/dc-crime) of DC Crime from [2016 crimes on DC Open Data](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/bda20763840448b58f8383bae800a843_26).


- [See Temporal Visualization](http://ajturner.github.io/dc-crime/index.html)

The second is a ["crime near me" viewer](http://ajturner.github.io/dc-crime/nearby/index.html) where you can enter an address and see nearby crime incidents as well as demographics and social tapestry.

## Technology

- [cublet](https://github.com/chelm/cublet) to convert GeoJSON into tilecubes
- [esri-tilecube-layer](https://github.com/chelm/esri-tilecube-layer) to add to a map
- [Local Perspective](https://github.com/SpatialAgent/local-perspective) app template

a Work in Progress...
